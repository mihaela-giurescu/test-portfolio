    <h1>Mihaela Giurescu's Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Check out my hobbies y'all. Heads up, might be sounding tiny bit high-hat, 'cause even though I might be obsessed with some of these, I find myself far from actually productively indulging into the each topic. But, I guess, that's why you call them hobbies and not skills. But I hope to one day be able to effectively make the leap and, satisfy the societal thirst of marketing off of them. PS. This was just a quick rant to actually avoid going further with the course. Or maybe it was just a cathartic attempt at mirroring what is yet to be learned.</p>
