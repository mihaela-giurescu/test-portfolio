    <p>The offical course is called </em><strong><q>The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp.</q></strong> And I found it on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Udemy</a>. A lot of the info is deprecated (such as using Atom, which was discontinued, as a code editor), but, the base is still useful as it gets the student into a certain mindset and arms you with a particular search focused or solution oriented skillset.</p>    
    <p>The course's claim is: <b><q>Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps.</q></b> Let's see what we'll be able to do with it.</em></p>

    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>I have studied psychology in the past and I currently work as a SEO manager for a brilliant Romanian company called IOS (International Online Solutions - I know, not a very inspired name, or is it?). You can check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihaela-giurescu/">Linkedin profile</a> for a more detailed overview of my previous experience and studies.</p>
    <p>When I do not study to become a future full stack programmer, I test different SEO hypothesis and strategies on my website, <a href="http://produseaurii.ro">Produse Aurii</a>, maintain my brother's website, <a
            href="https://nimenittt.com/">Nimenittt - International Tattoo Artist in Bucharest</a> and spend time with my family, my cat and my friends.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>My overarching goal is to maintain a healthy balance between my physical and mental health, make sure a exercize
        both my body and my mind a little bit daily, and eventually gather the strenght, the knowledge and the network
        necessary to launch and see through all the stages of success, my very own business. A social impacting
        business, something similar to what my close friend Andra has achieved with <a href="https://navafood.ro/">Nava</a></p>
